    Tool is an American metal band and brainchild of their frontman, Maynard James Keenan. They are best known for their profound lyrics, unique use of time signatures and overall thought-provoking music that straddles the line between musical and artistic expressions. Tool frequently includes mathematics in their works to create wholly idiosyncratic pieces of music that keep the listener pondering the meaning long after hearing it. Their music is so complex in creation it usually takes them years to put albums out, but when they do, it is an event to behold.

      Lateralus is an album realeased by Tool in 2001, the title track (Lateralus), is one of Tool's best songs ever recorded, and for good reason. The song is essentially mathmatically perfect down to every facet. I can't get into all the different ways this song is perfect here but, there is video that explains everything.

    This is Tool's debut hit, "Opiate", being released in 1992 on the EP of the same name, it is a strange song that has key notes of intense juxtaposition with lyrics, singing and instrumentals to match. Key themes of the song relate to Karl Marx's philosophy that "Religion is is the opiate of the masses."

This is the song, "Right in Two", featured on the 2006 album 10,000 Days. The song is about an angel speaking with his father and other angels about how "Monkeys" are killing each other over and over again over pieces of ground. It emphasises how petty human conflict must seem to all powerful beings.

"Pushit" is from the 1996 album, Ã†nima. It's a story of Maynard's struggle with being a victim of abuse from his parents. He goes back and forth fighting with himself throughout the song screaming about how much he wishes he could go and do the same to to them, but then he grapples with the fact that he would have to see them again to do that and it would only continue the cycle of abuse.
